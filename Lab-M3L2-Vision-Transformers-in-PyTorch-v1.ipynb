    "In this notebook, you will learn to build a PyTorch-based hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. \n",
    "You'll start by using CNN layers to extract detailed features, such as edges and textures, from images. Then, you'll see how those features are passed to a Vision Transformer, which looks at the global correlations in the entire image by looking at all locations at once. Then, you will train a hybrid CNN-ViT model, and by the end of this lab, you'll also know how to monitor its performance. This approach gives you practical experience with state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision!\n"

    "## Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MHSA** class implements the self-attention mechanism that enables the Vision Transformer to model long-range dependencies and global context across all spatial locations in the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation follows the scaled dot-product attention formula: **Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d)V**, where Q, K, and V represent query, key, and value matrices, respectively. The scaling factor 1/sqrt(d) prevents the dot products from becoming too large, which would push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-head mechanism splits the embedding dimension across multiple attention heads, allowing the model to attend to different types of relationships simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key implementation details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified QKV projection**: A single linear layer `nn.Linear(dim, dim*3)` generates Q, K, and V matrices efficiently, reducing memory overhead compared to separate projections\n",
    "- **Head reshaping**: The tensor is reshaped from (B, N, D) to (B, heads, N, d) where d = D/heads, enabling parallel processing across heads\n",
    "- **Attention computation**: Matrix multiplication `torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1))` computes attention scores, followed by scaling and softmax normalization\n",
    "- **Dropout regularization**: Two dropout layers prevent overfitting - one on attention weights and one on the final output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike CNNs, which have limited receptive fields, self-attention allows every token to interact directly with every other token in a single operation. This enables the model to **capture long-range spatial dependencies** that might be missed by purely convolutional approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In the hybrid architecture, this global modeling complements the local feature extraction performed by the CNN backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention weights provide interpretability, showing which spatial locations the model focuses on when making predictions. This component is valuable for both performance and explainability.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Layer normalization (nn.LayerNorm):** This helps stabilize and speed up training by normalizing each row of the input data, which is useful before applying attention or a neural network layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention layer (MHSA):** This is the “Multi-Head Self Attention” block. It enables the model to look at all positions in the sequence (or image patches) at once, figuring out which ones are most important for each output. It’s like giving the model the power to focus on the key parts of an image or sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MLP (nn.Sequential):** This is a **Multi-Layer Perceptron** or a mini neural network, made up of linear (fully connected) layers, a special activation (GELU), and dropout for regularization. This MLP has:\n",
    "- One linear layer that expands the input dimension by mlp_ratio (for example, 4× wider).\n",
    "- A GELU activation function (a nonlinear operation, similar to ReLU).\n",
    "- Dropout for regularization (helps prevent overfitting).\n",
    "- Another linear layer that shrinks the data back to the original dimension.\n",
    "- Another dropout layer.\n",
    "Here, MLP is designed to help the model learn better representations by combining and transforming the information after the attention step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip/Residual connections (x + ...):** These connections support effective and stable training for deep neural networks by keeping pathways open for both forward information flow and backward gradient flow, making deep architectures such as transformers possible and practical. In transformers, skip connections are placed around both the attention and feedforward (MLP) sub-layers in each block. This stabilizes training of these very deep, stackable models, improves convergence speed, and lets them scale to larger datasets and more complex tasks.\n",

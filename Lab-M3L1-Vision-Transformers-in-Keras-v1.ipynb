    "In this notebook, you will learn to build a CNN-Vision Transformer (ViT) hybrid image classification model. You will start by loading an existing CNN that is good at recognizing small patterns in pictures. Then, you'll learn how to improve it with a transformer, which helps the model see and use wider and more complex relationships in an image. The notebook covers important topics like preparing your image data, making your model smarter with both local and global learning, and saving your best results automatically. By the end, you'll understand how CNN-ViT hybrid models work and how to train, evaluate, and visualize them for any image classification task.\n"

    "In the CNN-ViT hybrid, these transformer blocks process the tokenized CNN feature maps, allowing the model to capture long-range spatial dependencies that CNNs might miss due to their limited receptive fields. The self-attention mechanism enables each spatial location to attend to all other locations, providing global context awareness.\n",

    "- **Multi-head attention (MHA):** Uses `layers.MultiHeadAttention` with a configurable number of heads and key dimension equal to embed_dim\n",

This function represents the main architectural innovation of the notebook, combining the strengths of convolutional neural networks for local feature extraction with transformers for global context modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function architecture:**\n",
    "1. **CNN feature extraction:** Extracts intermediate feature maps from a pre-trained CNN at a specified layer\n",
    "2. **Tokenization:** Reshapes spatial feature maps into a sequence of tokens suitable for transformer processing\n",
    "3. **Positional encoding:** Adds learnable positional embeddings to maintain spatial relationships\n",
    "4. **Transformer stack:** Applies multiple transformer encoder blocks for global context modeling\n",
    "5. **Classification head:** Pools tokens and applies the final classification layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `cnn_model`: Pre-trained CNN model for feature extraction\n",
    "- `feature_layer_name`: Name of the CNN layer to extract features from (e.g., `batch_normalization_5` in the original model architecture)\n",
    "- `num_transformer_layers`: Number of transformer blocks to stack (default 4)\n",
    "- `num_heads`: Number of attention heads per transformer block (default 8)\n",
    "- `mlp_dim`: MLP hidden dimension in transformer blocks (default 2048)\n",
    "- `num_classes`: Number of output classes for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first freezes the CNN backbone (`cnn_model.trainable = False`) to use it as a fixed feature extractor. It then extracts feature maps with shape (B, H, W, C) and reshapes them to (B, H*W, C), where each spatial location becomes a token. The `AddPositionEmbedding` layer adds spatial awareness, and multiple TransformerBlock layers process the tokens. Finally, `GlobalAveragePooling1D` aggregates all tokens, and a dense layer with softmax activation produces class predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach leverages CNN's local feature detection capabilities while adding the transformer's global attention mechanism. The result is a model that can capture both fine-grained local patterns and long-range spatial dependencies, potentially **outperforming pure CNN** or pure transformer approaches on vision tasks.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built a CNN-ViT hybrid image classification model.\n",
    "In this lab, you learnt how to combine a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Vision Transformer (ViT) for advanced image classification tasks. Starting from a pre-trained CNN, you learnt how to extract intermediate features, reshape them as tokens, and provide them with positional embeddings. By stacking transformer encoder blocks on top, the model benefits from both local detail extraction and global context awareness. Throughout the lab, techniques for robust data preparation, efficient training with model checkpoints, and effective visualization of performance were covered. By completing the steps in this notebook, you now have hands-on experience implementing and evaluating a contemporary hybrid vision model using Keras.\n"
